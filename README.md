YAK Pro - PHP Obfuscator is an obfuscation tool used to protect the source code of PHP applications. To use it, follow these steps:

Download and install YAK Pro - PHP Obfuscator on your system.

Open the command line and navigate to the directory where the PHP file you want to obfuscate is located.

Run the command "yakpro -po file.php" at the command line, where "file.php" is the name of the file you want to obfuscate.

YAK Pro - PHP Obfuscator will generate a new file called "file.php.obfuscated". This is the obfuscated file that you should use instead of the original file.

It is important to note that obfuscation does not guarantee the complete security of the source code, but it can make it difficult for someone to easily understand or modify it. Also, obfuscation can make code more difficult to debug and maintain. Therefore, it is recommended to use obfuscation with caution and only when necessary.
